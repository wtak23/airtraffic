Project Overview
""""""""""""""""
To narrow the scope of my analysis, I decided to focus on the air-traffic data from Nov-1-2015 to Oct-31-2016. This is the latest available data provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistic, and completes a full year cycle.

The project is broken down into three-parts, each having its own separate `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`__ page that allows me to present the result alongside with the analysis code.

.. rubric:: A quick remark

About 65-75% of the content in my Jupyter notebooks are occupied by codes (most of the effort towards "`tidying <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data>`__" the data-table). I put my best effort in making the visualization charts as self-explanatory as possible, so if you are only interested in the "punchline" of the analysis, please scroll thorough the code and pause whenever you see a figure/chart.

.. rubric:: Part 1. Air-traffic trend analysis (`main notebook <http://takwatanabe.me/airtraffic/flight-count-analysis.html>`__)

- Here I analyzed the general trend in the frequency of flight-counts in the US as a time-series signal. 
- The goal was to identify some interesting trend in the flight-counts at different time (eg, day-of-week, month, end of year) and location (eg, densely populated area, location of **hub** airports).
- Example types of questions asked: 

  - Is there any day/time of the year when the US flight-counts takes a dip/hike? 
  - does Honolulu airport attract more visitors during the winter-time? 
  - Is there a trend in fight counts that is specific to airports at major cities like NY/LA? W
  - which airport in the US is the busiest i terms of flight-counts?

.. Since this is a data science project, much of my effort was spent towards interacting with the data through **coding**, with the goal of identifying some "interesting" trend in the data, which inevitably involves some painstaking trial-and-error process.
