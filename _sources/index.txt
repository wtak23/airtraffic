   Network representing community structure in the US airport traffic during the past year (Nov 2015 - Oct 2016), with the node-color representing the community each airport belongs to.  Click on figure to open in a separate tab and zoom; figures are in SVG format, so zoom in as you wish :)

.. Here, node-size is proportional to the number of flights made to/at the airport, whereas the edge-width is proportional to the number of flights made between two airports.
